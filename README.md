## Natural Products - Project

The brief was to build a full-stack application with a React front-end and PostgreSQL database. The application had to include data schema and a RESTful api framework to enable a user to register, login and add content.

The application is deployed via Git on Heroku and can be found here: [Natura cosmetics](https://natura-cosmetics.herokuapp.com/#/)

## Installation

* Clone or Download the repo and from the terminal run the following commands:
  - yarn to install JavaScript packages.
  - pipenv to install Python packages.

* Next run:
  - yarn seeds to create the initial data for the database
  - yarn run:server - To launch the server
  - yarn run:client - To launch the front-end

Natural products application allows a user to register, login, add products, edit content, find Natura productsâ€™ location, search products and check availability.

Before building the front end I tested the API endpoints using Insomnia.
